## Strategies

Radar Relay Bot strategies make use of the Radar Relay SDK to define an automated trading strategy. Strategies extend the base `Strategy` class (see `src/lib/strategy.ts`) which defines an interface with several required methods for a basic trading strategy.

By default the `Strategy` class contains the following class instances:

**`rr`**: An instance of the Radar Relay SDK.

**`prompt`**: An instance of the CLI prompt class.

**`ccxt`**: An instance of the CCXT class used to obtain GBBOs.

**`conf`**: Configuration parameters for this strategy generated by the `config.yml` file.

### Creating a New Strategy

1. Create a new folder in `src/strategies`.
2. Add `src/strategies/your-strategy/index.ts` which should export a class that extends the base `Strategy` class.
3. Include your strategy in `src/strategies/index.ts`.
4. Import the new strategy in `src/index.ts`
5. Add CLI access to the strategy via the optionsPrompt and switch located at the bottom of `src/index.ts`
